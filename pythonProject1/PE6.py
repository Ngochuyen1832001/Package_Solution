#Given a string, the task is to check  if that string contains any special character (defined special character set).
#If any special character is found, donâ€™t accept that string.
#Examples :    Input : Billy$is$goat Father  Output : String is not accepted.
#Input : Billy is a goat Father  Output : String is accepted
